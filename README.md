# Django Library Application
Basic Library application built using Django.

# TODO
- Finish Author section
    - Decide how Author section should be built: as seperate page or BookListView with view limited to Author
- Build All Loan page
- Build My Loans page (Maybe this should just be apart of the User page)
- Added search functionality
- Add a User page so that staff can click on a user profile and see all the borrowed books a user has.
- Add a way to loan a book out (Create Loan Page)
